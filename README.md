# About-Me
Hi, I'm Paulina! I'm a UIC computer science student graduating in May of 2027. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and expand the extent of my knowledge. I have worked in Java and C and I’m eager to apply these skills in a professional setting. As I continue to expand my abilities, I'm looking to use what I’ve learned at a Chicago-based company and accomplish goals that align with my passion for technology and innovation. I’m particularly interested in software development and data analysis, and I strive to contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems. I am excited to connect and collaborate with others who share a commitment to growing in the tech industry.
