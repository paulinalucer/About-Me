# About-Me
Hi, I'm Paulina! I'm a UIC computer science student graduating in May of 2027. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and expand the extent of my knowledge. While I am still broadening my skills, I am looking to use and grow my knowledge at a chicago based company and accomplish goals that align with my passion for technology and innovation. Iâ€™m particularly interested in software development and data analysis, and I strive to contribute to impactful projects that solve real-world problems. I am excited to connect and collaborate with others who share a commitment to growing in the tech space.
